## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User uploads dataset (CSV format)
2. Selects:
   - Sensitive attribute (e.g., gender)
   - Target variable (e.g., approval)
3. System computes fairness metrics:
   - Demographic Parity
   - Disparate Impact
4. Bias report is generated
5. LLM analyzes results and provides:
   - Explanation
   - Risk assessment
   - Actionable suggestions
6. Results are visualized on dashboard
7. Model performance is tracked using MLflow
